# DnD
A D&amp;D RPG game website with character sheet and the ability to create character.
This website is for the ones that love to play the tabletop D&D game, but cant find anyone local to play with. This site allows everyone to create there own characters just like you would if you were playing in front of someone, and edit the character sheet as needed during your adventure. This is all written in html and PHP so editing the files for yourself should be simple.
